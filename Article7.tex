		%Should the downfall of Western Civilization occur, you should immediately acquire Rummy Bears and then acquire drunk bitches.
        %The former can be created by placing a large amount of rum in a bowl, then placing Gummy Bears in that bowl and leaving them to soak overnight.
        %This author has no idea where to find the latter.
		\item \hyperref[alcohol]{Article VII, Section A, \autoref*{alcohol}}, \hyperref[alcohol-storage]{Article VII, Section A, \autoref*{alcohol-storage}}, and \hyperref[tobacco]{Article VII, Section A, \autoref*{tobacco}} will become null and void upon the downfall of Western Civilization.
	\end{enumerate}

%Housing will work as prescribed unless someone is not screwed over. If nobody is screwed over, the Vice-President will construct housing to screw over the maximum number of people.
\section{Housing Eligibility}

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item All active brothers are to live in the chapter house pursuant to Article V, Section 10 of the \gls{ibl}.\label{in-house}
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item The following brothers are exempt from this policy:
					
					\begin{enumerate}
						\item 1st year students
						\item Commuter Students
						\item Those who are married
						\item Those who receive housing as compensation for employment (e.g. Resident Assistants)

						\item Those who were exempt at the beginning of the school year
                        \item Those with a prohibitive medical condition as approved by \gls{ec}
                        \item Those who were ineligible at the beginning of the academic year 
					\end{enumerate}
			\end{enumerate}

		\item The following brothers must live in the chapter house: \label{ec-in-house}

				\item Vice President of Health and Safety
				\item Secretary
				\item Treasurer

		\item In order for a brother to move in to the house, he must not be on \gls{fin-probation} and must not have a debt exceeding \$3000, including \glspl{defer}.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Brothers living in the house during the fall of any year are exempt from this stipulation for the spring semester of that year only.
        \end{enumerate}

		\item Brothers living in the house must have a signed housing contract by the due date (\hyperref[housing-contract]{Article V, Section D, \autoref*{housing-contract}}). 

		\item Alumni will be permitted one semester after graduation or status change to live in the house without chapter approval. After that semester, the brother in question must receive a \gls{super-maj} vote in order to remain in the house. %Case policy says that a person must be taking classes to live in the house. Alums living in must be grad students. Students who have dropped out are in a kind of grey area.
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Alumni must be taking classes at \gls{cwru} to live in the house (i.e. as a graduate student).
			\end{enumerate}

	\end{enumerate}

\section{Room Assignments}

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The Vice President will present a housing plan for the next semester to the chapter at the regularly scheduled chapter meeting following Executive Council Elections.
			
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item The plan must be approved by \gls{super-maj} vote.
			\end{enumerate}

		\item If the number of brothers eligible to live in the house exceeds the capacity of the house:
			
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Brothers who have lived in the house during the school year for at least one semester will be allowed the option of moving out in order of \gls{roster} from lowest to highest. \label{move-out}

					\begin{enumerate}
						\item The house may not be dropped below capacity.

						\item If this method would bring the house below capacity: 
							\begin{enumerate}
								\item Of the brothers with the highest \gls{roster} among those who wish to move out, select the number of brothers that would bring the house to capacity by a mutually acceptable method.
							\end{enumerate}
					\end{enumerate}

				\item If, after application of the method described in \hyperref[move-out]{Article VII, Section C, \autoref*{move-out}}, the house is still above capacity, brothers who have lived the most semesters in the house (excluding summer) will be forced to move out.
					
					\begin{enumerate}
						\item If two or more brothers have lived in the house the same amount of time, the one with the lowest unmodified \gls{roster} will be forced to move out first.

						\item If two or more brothers have lived in the house the same amount of time and have the same unmodified \gls{roster}, the decision will be made by a mutually acceptable method.

						\item Brothers listed in \hyperref[ec-in-house]{Article VII, Section B, \autoref*{ec-in-house}} cannot be forced to live out of the house.
					\end{enumerate}
			\end{enumerate}

		\item Any brother applying for a room must have less than \$50 debt, including \glspl{defer}, at the time room assignments are made, lest he become \gls{staggard}.

		\item Room 307 is reserved for the President unless he waives this right.

		\item Room assignments will be made by the Vice President following these guidelines: \label{housing-guidelines}
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item If two or more groups of brothers wish to occupy the same room, the room will be assigned to:

					\begin{enumerate}
						\item The group with the most brothers, not to exceed the capacity of the room; else
						\item The group of brothers with the greatest number of brothers with \gls{squatters} for that particular room; else
						\item The group of brothers with the lowest aggregate \gls{roster}; else
						\item The group of brothers decided by a mutually acceptable method.
					\end{enumerate}
			\end{enumerate}

		\item The Vice President will have penultimate authority, beneath the chapter, to assign rooms to the best of his ability in keeping with the guidelines established in \hyperref[housing-guidelines]{Article VII, Section C, \autoref*{housing-guidelines}}.

	\end{enumerate}
