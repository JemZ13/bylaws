\chapter{EC Interpretations}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Academic warning is treated the same way as \gls{academic-probation} when a brother has not had classes for a semester.
	\item Standards Board does NOT need to automatically recommend a brother for suspension if said brother is brought up for standards with the possibility of suspension.
	\item A brother may appeal a decision of Standards Board within five days of receiving written notification of the results of the hearing is intended to mean, "Within five days of the chapter being notified of the results of the hearing".
	\item "Move in to the house" means physically moving into the house during the semester in question.  Brothers can be on the housing plan if they owe above this limit, but will be refused living space in the house if their debts are above this limit when it comes time to move in.
\end{enumerate}
