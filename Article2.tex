		\end{enumerate}

	\section{Categories and Duration}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Temporary legislation 
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Will be in effect for one year from the date of enactment specified by the legislation.
				\item Expires one year from the date of passage if the date of enactment is not specified.

			\end{enumerate}
			\item Permanent legislation
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Will remain in effect indefinitely, until revoked or amended as specified below.
				\item Will be added to the appropriate appendix by the Vice President.
			\end{enumerate}
			\item Emergency legislation:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Can be passed by a vote 50\% of those present and eligible to vote even if \gls{qorm} is not present. %While we normally discourage explicitly stating the type of vote (use of the glossary is preferred), it needed to be in this place so as to avoid having to say "providing quorum is present" everywhere else.
				\item At the next chapter meeting where \gls{qorm} is present, the Vice President will bring the emergency legislation before the chapter as permanent or temporary legislation.
			\end{enumerate}
			\item Executive Edicts
			\label{exec-edict}
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Must be approved by an \gls{abs-maj} vote of \gls{ec}, which immediately puts the edict into effect as legislation.
				\item Supersede all previous legislation.
				\item At the next chapter meeting at which \gls{qorm} is present, the Vice President will bring the edict before the chapter as permanent or temporary legislation. The chapter must then approve the legislation for the edict to remain in effect. %During the next revision, try to fix all structures like this.
			\end{enumerate}
			\item If the legislation is not proposed as one of the above types, it will be treated as temporary legislation.
		\end{enumerate}
