\newglossaryentry{staggard}{name=staggard,description={A brother who is staggard loses \gls{squatters} and has 100 added to his \gls{roster}. This effect stacks with itself}}
%Explanation: While revising the bylaws in 2010, Matthew Richter had been writing some things on a white board referring to officer terms, if I recall correctly, and meant to write that the terms should be ``staggered". Instead, he wrote ``staggard". Since the condition now known as staggard was peppered throughout the bylaws, we wanted to give it a term so that the bylaws could be shortened. Someone suggested staggard since we had been making fun of Richter for it and we decided to keep it. Later, we found out that it is a real word. From the American Heritage dictionary, "A male red deer in its fourth year." It is middle English from "Stagge" which is related to "Stag".
